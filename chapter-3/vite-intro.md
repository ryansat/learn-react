Vite (French word for "fast", pronounced /vit/) is a modern front-end build tool created by Evan You, the original author of Vue.js. It offers a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. Here's a little more detail:

1. **Development Speed:** Vite improves the development startup time by offering an instant server start. It leverages JavaScript's native ES modules (ESM) to serve code without any bundling during development, which leads to instant server start-up. 

2. **Hot Module Replacement (HMR):** Vite provides out-of-the-box Hot Module Replacement (HMR). It performs HMR updates instantaneously without waiting for a page reload. This makes it a good choice for complex applications where preserving state during development can be a big productivity boost.

3. **Optimized Builds:** For production, Vite uses Rollup to bundle your code. Rollup is more efficient than webpack for code-splitting and can result in smaller file sizes thanks to its "tree-shaking" capabilities (removing unused code). Also, Vite itself pre-bundles dependencies for faster page loads in development.

4. **Rich Features:** Vite comes with many features out of the box, such as CSS code splitting and asset imports. It also has first-class support for JavaScript (ESM), Vue, and React, and can support many other frameworks through plugins. 

5. **Compatibility:** Vite ensures compatibility with many popular tools and plugins out of the box, including TypeScript, CSS Preprocessors, JSX, and PostCSS.

6. **Fast Refresh:** Similar to React Fast Refresh, Vite supports preserving state during component re-rendering which helps in faster development.

The reason why you might want to use Vite comes down to its speed, lean configuration, and out-of-the-box features that are specifically designed for modern JavaScript frameworks. It's a tool that caters to the modern front-end workflow, offering both speed in development and optimality in production.
