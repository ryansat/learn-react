## Introduction

Before diving into React, it's important to familiarize yourself with some fundamental JavaScript (ES6) concepts and TypeScript basics. This guide will help you understand these concepts, and then it will introduce you to Yarn and Vite for managing and running your projects.

- **Rest and Spread Operators**
- **Promises and Async/Await**
- **Modules (Import/Export)**
- **Classes**
- **Map, Filter, Reduce**

Please check out the [JavaScript ES6](./javascript-es6.md) file for more detailed explanations and examples on these topics.

## TypeScript Basics

TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. Here are some fundamental TypeScript topics:

- **Basic Types**
- **Enum**
- **Any**
- **Functions**
